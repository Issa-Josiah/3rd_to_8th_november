🧠 Concepts Covered
🔹 Source Code

Source code refers to the collection of files and instructions that make up a software project. It’s what developers write before it becomes the final working product.

🔹 Version Control

Version control systems (like Git) allow multiple developers to work on the same project efficiently, track changes, and manage branches without overwriting each other’s work.

🔹 GitHub

GitHub acts as a cloud-based platform to host Git repositories, collaborate with other developers, and manage project versions securely.

🗓️ Lesson Summary

“The source code has to be stored in a container.
The container can be local or cloud-based.
Other engineers can branch off, work their magic,
and send updates back — that’s version control.”
